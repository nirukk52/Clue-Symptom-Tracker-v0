# Who Struggles Most with Symptom Tracking and Why

Understanding which patient populations face the most severe symptom tracking challenges reveals critical opportunities for intervention. Multiple user groups struggle with tracking and communicating symptoms to healthcare providers, but they face distinct barriers shaped by their unique circumstances and needs.

## Chronic illness patients emerge as the most burdened population

Patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) had an average of 3.5 chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, chronic pain, and depression, and had regular relationships with an average of 5 providers[1]. Four major themes arose from the interviews: (1) tracking this data feels like work for many patients, (2) personal medical data for individuals with chronic conditions are not simply objective facts, but instead provoke strong positive and negative emotions, value judgments, and diverse interpretations, (3) patients track for different purposes, ranging from sense-making to self-management to reporting to the doctor, and (4) patients often notice that physicians trust technologically measured data such as lab reports over patients' self-tracked data[1].

A population with particularly complex and ongoing health needs is the 90 million Americans who have multiple chronic conditions (MCC). MCC disproportionately affects the elderly and the less affluent[1]. The tracking burden for this population is substantial because similar themes have been found in some individual chronic diseases but appeared more complex because patients often encountered "illness work" connected to multiple diseases simultaneously and frequently faced additional challenges from aging or difficult comorbidities such as chronic pain, depression, and anxiety[1].

## Caregivers face compounding responsibilities and emotional strain

With a substantial increase in the aging population comes a growing demand for caregivers, particularly informal caregivers who provide unpaid care to older adults with complex needs[2]. However, they face substantial physical, emotional, and financial burdens as they balance caregiving with their family and job demands[2].

The demographic profile reveals additional challenges: Caregivers' roles ranged from medical (insurance and medication assistance, etc.) at 63.8% to the provision of non-medical related resources (basic needs, utility, transportation, financial assistance, etc.) at 96.3%. Caregiving is also associated with some positive outcomes, such as changes in knowledge and skills (77.5%) with more confidence in ADL support tasks and a deepening of caregiver/care recipient dyad relationships (56.3%)[2]. However, some faced challenges in navigating complex healthcare and social service systems and others experienced neglect and received inadequate support from the government-supported social services (33.8%)[2].

Critically, there is no significant variation between those with 0-4 and 5+ years of experience across all identified themes, suggesting that the burdens and resource needs of caregivers can manifest early on and are likely to persist beyond the five-year mark. Our findings reveal that the number of caregiving years does not significantly influence the types of caregiving burden experienced by caregivers or the resources they require[2].

## Elderly patients with cognitive impairment face unique tracking barriers

About 93% have at least one chronic condition, and nearly 80% of have two or more[3]. Nearly 50% of older adults take one or more medications that are not medically necessary[4], complicating symptom tracking efforts.

This cross-sectional study involved 3909 web-based myGoalNav users (mostly caregivers of people with dementia or MCI) who completed symptom profiles between 2006 and 2019. To make a symptom profile, users selected their most personally meaningful or troublesome dementia-related symptoms to track over time. Users were also asked to rank their chosen symptoms from least to most important, which we called the symptom potency[5]. The research revealed that the symptoms that were ranked as most personally important by users were generally among the least frequently selected. Through individualization, patient-centered instruments such as myGoalNav can complement standardized measures by capturing these infrequent but potent outcomes[5].

## Parents tracking children's symptoms navigate complex barriers

The most commonly reported barriers were lack of information about were to seek help (60.3%), the perception that professionals did not listen (59.8%) and professionals refusing to initiate interventions or provide referral to services (53.7%). Lack of knowledge, stigmatization and unavailability of services were common themes across barriers to help-seeking[6].

Long symptom duration and parent rated impairment was associated with increased risk of reporting several barriers to help-seeking[6]. The consequences are significant: Parents seeking help for their child's mental health encounter numerous barriers that could explain part of the treatment gap and long duration of mental health problems in children prior to referral to CAMHS[6].

## The most burdened face systematic disadvantages

MCC is predominantly a condition of the elderly and disproportionately affects the less affluent, so it also seems possible that the barriers to use of consumer HIT would be particularly severe for this patient population[1]. Of particular concern from a public health standpoint, the use of consumer HIT remains lowest among the groups that might be most likely to benefit from additional forms of low-cost disease management support: people who are elderly, less educated, or less affluent[1].

Women face particular burdens as informal caregivers: Self-prioritisation, support and culture all had a significant impact on whether women followed self-management recommendations. Certain groups of women such as those living remotely, those with financial difficulties, migrants and those who do not speak the predominant language appear to face additional barriers to self-management[7].

## Tracking frequency varies widely but challenges persist

For chronic illness patients, fewer than half regularly tracked data by self-testing or recording daily activities. The most common example of self-tracking was patients with diabetes monitoring their blood glucose. Among the 16 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 11 mentioned self-monitoring blood glucose in some fashion (some were fairly regular, some checked values occasionally, and some said they used to monitor regularly but had stopped)[1].

## The emotional and practical toll of tracking

Indicators such as blood glucose, weight, and lab values were not discussed as value-free facts but instead carried strong emotional and evaluative connotations. People recognized tracking as work, judged themselves as "good" or "bad" for their data and their diligence in collecting it, and noted that data should be considered within the patient's personal context[1].

The consequences of poor tracking are severe. Wrong thought regarding mental disorders (60.1%) and being ashamed (58.9%) were identified to be the most common and significant barriers (P < 0.001) that prevent people from obtaining healthcare providers' assistance. Moreover, many individuals believed that untreated mental illness could lead to problems with family and friends (69.2%) as well as to suicidal thoughts (56.3%)[8].

## Population size and characteristics reveal urgent need

The scale of affected populations is substantial. Nearly 58 million Americans are 65 and older, with projections estimating that the population of older adults will grow to 88.8 million in 2060. On average, a 65-year-old can expect to live another 18.9 years[3]. It is estimated that 27% of the U.S. adult population has multiple chronic conditions, which cost the American health care system over $1 trillion each year[3].

## Technology adoption offers hope but challenges remain

For the 70 percent of older Americans who manage chronic health conditions and 27 percent of those over age 50 who are caregivers, advances in technology and digital services have made a significant difference[9]. However, Concern over data privacy is the biggest barrier to tech adoption, according to one-third of older Americans polled. Other barriers keeping people from engaging with new technology include ease of use (20 percent), set-up and support (19 percent), cost (16 percent) and awareness (12 percent)[9].

The research evidence is clear: patients with multiple chronic conditions, their caregivers, elderly adults managing polypharmacy, and parents navigating children's mental health represent the most severely burdened groups. Their challenges stem not from lack of effort but from systematic barriers including complex healthcare navigation, emotional burden of tracking, limited provider trust in patient-reported data, and insufficient support systems. Solutions must address these fundamental structural issues while recognizing that tracking burden manifests early and persists throughout the caregiving journey.
