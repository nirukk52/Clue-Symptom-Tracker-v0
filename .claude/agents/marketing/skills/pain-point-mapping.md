# Pain Point Mapping

How to connect research insights to campaign messaging.

## Process

1. **Identify the pain** - What specific frustration?
2. **Find the evidence** - Quote from research with source
3. **Flip to benefit** - How does Chronic Life solve this?
4. **Craft the hook** - One line that captures both

## Pain → Message Matrix

| Pain Point                     | Evidence                                                              | Chronic Life Solution                       | Hook                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tracking too hard with fatigue | "Every day is discomfort... last thing I think of is writing it down" | 20-second check-ins                         | "Track without draining your energy" |
| Forgetting symptoms            | Memory lapses due to brain fog                                        | Always-there assistant that remembers       | "Never forget a symptom again"       |
| Too many symptoms              | Overwhelmed by complexity                                             | Smart defaults, learns your patterns        | "No symptom left behind"             |
| No motivation                  | "What's the point?"                                                   | Doctor-ready summaries, actionable insights | "Make tracking worth it"             |
| Apps are overwhelming          | Complex forms, too many fields                                        | One-screen check-in, flare mode             | "Symptom tracking made simple"       |

## Research Citation Format

When pulling from research docs:

```
"[Quote]" — [Source file], Pain #[number]
```

Example:

```
"Every day is major discomfort... the last thing I think of is writing it down"
— pain-points.md, Pain #1
```

## Angle Selection

Choose angle based on:

1. **Condition context** - What matters most to this community?

   - Endo: Pain cycles, period tracking
   - PCOS: Hormone patterns, fatigue
   - Long COVID: Brain fog, energy management
   - Fibro: Flare prediction, pain patterns

2. **Pain severity** - Higher = more urgent messaging

   - Severity 10/10: Lead with empathy ("We know it's hard")
   - Severity 6/10: Lead with solution ("Here's how")

3. **Past performance** - What angles converted?
   - Check `knowledge/campaigns/index.md` for results
   - Double down on winners, iterate on losers

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**

- Use generic "track your health" messaging
- Promise medical advice or diagnosis
- Use clinical/hospital imagery
- Sound like every other app

**Do:**

- Acknowledge the struggle specifically
- Focus on energy conservation
- Emphasize evidence for doctors
- Sound like a friend who gets it
