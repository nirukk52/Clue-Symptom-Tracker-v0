## Strategy

**Target:** Endometriosis community
**Pain Point:** Tracking is too hard with fatigue (#1 from research)
**Angle:** Track without draining energy

**Key Quote:**

> "Every day is major discomfort... the last thing I think of is writing it down"
> — pain-points.md, Pain #1

## Website Copy

**Hero Headline:** Track symptoms without draining your energy.
**Hero Subhead:** 20-second check-ins, flare mode on bad days, and a history that works when brain fog hits.
**Primary CTA:** Start a 20-second check-in
**Secondary CTA:** Meet your assistant

## Image Prompt

### Hero Image (image_v1)

```
Vertical and horizontal versions of a modern, calming mobile-app hero image for a chat-first symptom tracker.

Scene: a hand holding a phone showing a clean screen that reads: 'Track symptoms without draining your energy.' Below it, smaller text: '20-second check-ins • Flare Mode • Doctor-ready export'.

Visual style: warm cream background, soft purple + peach accents, minimal gradients, gentle shadows, premium fintech-like clarity.

Include a subtle card UI showing 'How does my Sleep impact my Pain?'

Keep typography perfectly legible, centered, no distortions. No medical imagery, no hospitals, no stock-photo look.

Ultra clean, product-marketing aesthetic, high resolution.

## Next Iteration Ideas

- Test "flare mode" focused headline
- Try testimonial format ad
- A/B test CTA: "20-second check-in" vs "Try it free"
