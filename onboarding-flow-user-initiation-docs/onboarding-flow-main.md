# Onboarding Flow Outline

## Screen 1: Primary Concern (Q1)

**Question:** _"What's been the hardest to manage lately?"_ &lt;br&gt; _(User selects one option; this tailors the rest of the onboarding.)_

**Options:**
\- **Fatigue / Low energy** - _e.g._ frequent crashes, post-exertional malaise (PEM), can't get going
\- **Unpredictable flares** - _e.g._ sudden "bad days" you can't plan for
\- **Migraines / headaches** - _e.g._ attacks that derail everything
\- **Digestive issues / IBS** - _e.g._ bloating, pain, unpredictable bathroom trips
\- **Multiple conditions** - _e.g._ everything overlaps, tracking gets messy
\- **Something else (Other)** - _your main issue isn't listed above_

## Screen 2: Specific Focus (Q2)

_Q2 is a follow-up question that depends on the user's Q1 choice. It identifies what the user most wants to figure out or focus on. Each Q2 is phrased in a conversational, empathetic tone, referencing the user's specific challenge._

**If Q1 = Fatigue / Low Energy:**
_"What do you hope to figure out about your fatigue?"_
\- _When during the day I'm most fatigued vs. when I have energy_
\- _If certain activities (exercise, outings) are causing me to crash_
\- _Whether better sleep improves my energy levels_
\- _How my fatigue and mood might be connected_
\- _No specific focus - I'll track everything and see what comes up_

**If Q1 = Unpredictable Flares:**
_"What do you want to figure out about those flares?"_
\- _What might be triggering my flare-ups_
\- _If I can spot any early warning signs before a flare_
\- _Whether my treatments or routines are reducing my flares_
\- _If flares follow any pattern (e.g. time of month or activity)_
\- _Not sure yet - I just need to log flares and look for patterns later_

**If Q1 = Migraines / Headaches:**
_"What do you hope to understand about your migraines?"_
\- _Which foods or drinks might trigger my migraines_
\- _If weather changes (humidity, storms) correlate with my headaches_
\- _Whether my migraines are linked to hormonal cycles_
\- _If stress or poor sleep are setting off my migraines_
\- _I don't know yet - I'll track them and see if any pattern emerges_

**If Q1 = Digestive Issues / IBS:**
_"What would you like to understand about your digestive issues?"_
\- _Which foods might be causing my GI flare-ups_
\- _If stress or anxiety is making my symptoms worse_
\- _What time of day my gut issues are most intense_
\- _Whether my diet or medications are improving my symptoms_
\- _No specific idea - I'll track everything and look for trends_

**If Q1 = Multiple Conditions:**
_"What's your biggest challenge with managing multiple conditions?"_
\- _Figuring out which condition is causing what symptom_
\- _Juggling different medications or treatments for each_
\- _Seeing all my symptoms in one combined timeline_
\- _Prioritizing which issue to tackle first_
\- _Tracking it all without getting overwhelmed_

**If Q1 = Something Else (Other):**
_"What would you like to focus on by tracking your health?"_
\- _Find patterns or triggers for my symptoms_
\- _Track if my new treatment or habit is making a difference_
\- _Have a log I can share with my doctor (or keep for myself)_
\- _See overall trends in my health over time_
\- _I'm just curious - I want to try tracking and see what I learn_

_(Each Q2 answer effectively "buckets" the user into a specific use-case/persona, which will tailor the next question and the value proposition.)_

## Screen 3: Baseline Check-In (Q3)

_Based on the combination of Q1 and Q2, the user gets a personalized Q3 - a single baseline question in a warm, conversational tone. This helps establish a starting point (baseline) for their primary concern. Below are the 30 possible Q3 questions (one for each Q1+Q2 combo), with suggested intuitive answer formats (text, multiple choice, slider, etc.):_

**Fatigue / Low Energy:**
\- **When during the day I'm most fatigued vs. energetic** → _"When do you usually feel the most drained during the day?"_ (Multiple choice: **Morning**, **Afternoon**, **Evening**, or **Varies daily**)

\- **Prioritizing which issue first** → _"Which condition or symptom is bothering you the most right now?"_ (Open text input for user's answer)
\- **Manage everything (overwhelm)** → _"On a scale of 1-10, how overwhelmed do you feel managing your health lately?"_ (Slider: **1-10**, 1 = not at all, 10 = completely overwhelmed)

**Something Else (Other):**

\- **Just curious to track** → _"Out of the past 30 days, about how many were 'good' (relatively symptom-free) days for you?"_ (Slider: **0-30** good days)

_(Each Q3 question uses friendly, understanding language (per our "language of care" guidelines) - acknowledging the user's struggle and aiming to make logging feel supportive rather than clinical. The answer formats are chosen to be as intuitive as possible: sliders for rating scales or frequencies, multiple-choice for qualitative feelings, and multi-select for potential factors/triggers, etc. This gives the user a quick, easy way to establish their personal baseline.)_

## Screen 4: Sign-Up & Personalized Value Proposition

_After Q3, the user is prompted to sign up (via Google or email/password). Before the sign-in options, the app shows a tailored value proposition - a glimpse of how tracking will help them, based on what they care about (their Q1 and Q2 choices). This includes a short encouraging statement and a preview-style widget or graphic illustrating future insights they'll gain. Below are 30 possible value props (one for each scenario):_

**Fatigue / Low Energy:**
\- _Daily energy pattern:_ **See a daily energy graph** pinpointing your high and low points, so you can plan rest when you'll need it most.
\- _Activity crashes (PEM):_ **Track activities vs. crashes** on a timeline - discover how long it takes to recover after exertion, helping you pace yourself better.
\- _Sleep correlation:_ **Correlate sleep with energy** - for example, view your sleep hours alongside next-day energy levels, so you can prove if better sleep = better energy.
\- _Mood connection:_ **Understand fatigue's impact on mood** - track fatigue and mood together to validate how you feel and know when to be gentle with yourself.
\- _Overall tracking (no specific focus):_ **Spot fatigue trends over time** - with all your fatigue data in one place, you might see patterns (like weekly cycles or gradual improvements) that help you manage better.

**Unpredictable Flares:**
\- _Identify triggers:_ **Find your flare triggers** - the app will highlight correlations (e.g. certain foods or weather on flare days) so you can avoid or prepare for them.
\- _Early warning signs:_ **Catch flares early** - by logging pre-flare symptoms, you'll start recognizing subtle signals and can take action before a small symptom becomes a full flare.
\- _Track treatments' effect:_ **Know what's working** - see a before-and-after chart of your flare frequency as you try new treatments or routines, giving you proof of what actually helps.
\- _Pattern/predictability:_ **Anticipate bad days** - our calendar view shows if flares cluster at certain times (like monthly or after busy weeks), so you can plan around likely "off" days.
\- _Logging everything:_ **Visualize your flare frequency** - for example, a monthly graph shows how often flares hit, helping you measure progress and feel more in control.

**Migraines / Headaches:**
\- _Food triggers:_ **Pinpoint food triggers** - log meals and headaches to see, say, a spike in migraines after chocolate or wine, so you know what to cut or limit.
\- _Weather triggers:_ **Weather vs. migraine tracker** - view your headache days alongside weather changes (humidity, pressure), helping you confirm if storms are a culprit.
\- _Hormonal link:_ **Cycle-related insights** - get a calendar overlay of migraine days with your menstrual cycle or hormonal schedule, so you can predict and prepare for high-risk days.
\- _Stress/sleep triggers:_ **Stress & sleep insights** - see your migraine log next to stress levels or sleep quality, showing patterns like "low sleep weeks = more migraines," which you can act on.
\- _General pattern tracking:_ **Monthly migraine trend** - a simple chart shows how many migraine days you have each month, so you can easily spot if you're improving or need to seek new treatment.

**Digestive Issues / IBS:**
\- _Food triggers:_ **Uncover food culprits** - track meals and symptoms together; the app will help flag foods (like dairy or spicy food) that often precede bad flare-ups.
\- _Stress impact:_ **Link stress to symptoms** - see a side-by-side of your stress diary and IBS symptoms, validating physical reactions to stress (it's not "just in your head"!) and helping you manage triggers.
\- _Timing patterns:_ **Daily symptom pattern** - visualize when symptoms strike (morning vs. evening) on a daily timeline, so you can adjust meal timing or activities accordingly.
\- _Treatment effectiveness:_ **Track treatment outcomes** - whether it's a new diet or medication, you'll get a clear before/after comparison of symptom severity, so you know if it's working.
\- _Overall trends:_ **Weekly symptom heatmap** - get an overview of how many days each week you experience symptoms, helping you gauge if you're having more good days over time.

**Multiple Conditions:**
\- _Which condition causes what:_ **Tag symptoms by condition** - log all symptoms in one place with labels (e.g. "migraine" vs "fibro pain"), then see patterns to help you tell which condition is flaring up.
\- _Managing multiple meds:_ **All treatments at a glance** - keep a combined log of medications and symptoms, so you can spot if one medication is causing side effects or if you're missing a dose.
\- _Unified timeline:_ **One unified health timeline** - instead of juggling separate journals, see all your health data on one timeline. This "big picture" view makes it easier to spot overlaps or interactions between conditions.
\- _Choosing a focus:_ **Focus without losing context** - highlight your top-priority symptom in the app and track it closely, while still monitoring other issues in the background. You'll see progress on your main issue without ignoring the rest.
\- _Reducing overwhelm:_ **Let the app do the organizing** - all your symptoms, for all conditions, get neatly charted for you. It's like having a personal health assistant, so you feel less overwhelmed and nothing falls through the cracks.

**Something Else (Other):**
\- _Find patterns/triggers:_ **Reveal hidden patterns** - by tracking everything in one place, you might discover triggers or trends unique to your situation that you'd otherwise miss.
\- _Track new habit's effect:_ **See if it's working** - get a clear graph of "before and after" for your new treatment or habit (symptom severity over time), so you'll know objectively if it's helping.
\- _Keep a log for doctor:_ **Have records ready for appointments** - with consistent tracking, you can show up to your doctor with charts and timelines instead of trying to recall from memory, making it easier to get proper care.
\- _See health trends:_ **Know your overall trajectory** - the app shows a trendline of your wellbeing (are symptoms getting better or worse?), helping you understand the big picture and adjust your management plan faster.
\- _Just curious (exploring):_ **Learn about yourself** - even if you're just exploring, you'll gain personal insights. The longer you track, the more the app can show you interesting correlations and progress, empowering you with knowledge about your body.

_(This personalized value prop screen uses an encouraging, hopeful tone -_ _"Understand your body faster and manage your symptoms better."_ _It highlights the_ _future benefit_ _of logging the data from Q3. For example, a user who cares about triggers might see a mock chart linking triggers to symptoms, with text like_ "Identify what triggers your flares so you can avoid them."\* This reassurance aims to motivate the user that signing up and continuing to track will lead to useful insights and improvements. The messaging draws on real spoonie experiences - addressing pain points like unpredictability, feeling misunderstood, or overwhelmed - and shows how the app will help solve those, making signing up the next logical step.)
