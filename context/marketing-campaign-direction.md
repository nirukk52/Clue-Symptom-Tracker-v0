ChronicLife: A $100 Reddit Campaign for Product Validation
Executive Summary
This document outlines 'The Clarity Experiment,' a $100, 10-day Reddit ad campaign designed to validate ChronicLife's core value proposition. By A/B testing three distinct messaging hypotheses—Exhaustion, Doctor Mistrust, and Pattern Discovery—we will identify the most resonant user pain point, measured by Click-Through Rate (CTR). The winning message will directly inform our product roadmap and serve as the foundation for our subsequent, larger-scale user acquisition campaign, ensuring future marketing spend is de-risked and data-driven.
This document outlines a low-budget, high-impact Reddit advertising campaign for the ChronicLife app. The primary objective is not user acquisition at scale, but strategic validation: to identify the most resonant user pain point and use this data to inform future product development and a subsequent, larger marketing campaign. For an early-stage app like ChronicLife, understanding the user's core problem is more valuable than acquiring users, and this $100 investment is a critical, data-driven experiment designed to de-risk future investment and achieve that clarity.
1.0 Strategic Framework & Core Hypothesis
This campaign is an exercise in targeted learning. By treating each ad group as a distinct hypothesis, we can efficiently test which user problem is most urgent and emotionally resonant. The framework below ensures that every dollar is spent to gather actionable data, shaping a smarter, more focused growth strategy for ChronicLife.
1.1 Guiding Mental Models
Three core mental models guide the structure and execution of this campaign:
• The "Hair on Fire" Model: The campaign's purpose is to discover which user problem is most urgent—the one that feels like their "hair is on fire." The three ad groups are designed as tests for distinct "hair on fire" scenarios: the sheer exhaustion of trying to track symptoms, the deep frustration of being ignored by doctors, and the overwhelming confusion of not understanding one's own symptom patterns.
• The "Magician's Choice" Model: This $100 test functions as a "magician's choice," where the winning ad copy from this experiment will be used directly in the next, larger campaign. This approach removes guesswork from future marketing spend. As the strategy document states, "You are paying $100 now to save wasting $400 later on the wrong message."
• The "20-Second Rule" Model: A critical creative constraint for all ads is the "20-Second Rule." Users with chronic illness, often managing limited energy reserves ("spoons"), judge cognitive and energy expenditure instantly. They will scroll past dense or complex ads. Therefore, all headlines must be under seven words, and visuals must be simple and emotionally resonant, such as the proposed "Spoon photo," which uses visual shorthand the community understands immediately.
1.2 Core Hypothesis & Success Metric
The campaign is built around a single, clear hypothesis:
By testing three distinct value propositions tied to user pain points (Exhaustion, Doctor Mistrust, Pattern Discovery), we can identify which message generates the highest Click-Through Rate (CTR), thereby validating the most critical problem ChronicLife should solve.
To that end, Click-Through Rate (CTR), not Cost Per Install (CPI), is the primary Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A high CTR is the most direct signal that an ad "hit a nerve" and strongly resonated with the target audience's core problem. A user clicking indicates that the message was compelling enough to warrant spending their limited energy to learn more.
This strategic framework provides the foundation for the practical execution of the campaign detailed below.
2.0 Campaign Naming & High-Level Details
The campaign name and structure are designed for clarity and rigorous testing, ensuring that every dollar spent generates a clear, actionable insight into user motivation. This methodical approach allows us to isolate variables and confidently identify the winning message.
2.1 Campaign Name
To reflect its experimental and data-gathering nature, the campaign will be named: "The Clarity Experiment".
2.2 Target Audience & Communities

1. Audience Profile: The target user is embodied by the "Emily, 30" persona, a "Data-Driven Long COVID Warrior." She is proactive, tech-savvy, and deeply motivated to find the root cause of her brain fog. She struggles with low energy on bad days, which makes complex or demanding tasks, including symptom tracking, feel overwhelming. Her primary frustrations stem from feeling dismissed by doctors—being told "it's just anxiety"—and the struggle to articulate her symptom patterns effectively. Beyond her proactive behavior, Emily is driven by a deep need for agency and validation. She embodies the 'health detective' archetype, seeking to regain control from the chaos of her symptoms and to be seen as a credible expert on her own body, a credibility often denied in clinical settings.
2. Target Reddit Communities: The following subreddits have been identified as primary targets due to their high concentration of users who match the audience profile and actively discuss the pain points this campaign addresses.
   Subreddit
   Rationale from Source
   r/BrainFog
   Directly targets a core symptom mentioned in multiple sources. Users here discuss cognitive struggles, tracking difficulties, and frustration with medical care.
   r/ChronicIllness
   A broad community where users discuss the emotional and logistical burdens of living with chronic conditions, including the feeling of being disbelieved.
   r/Fibromyalgia
   Targets users who experience "fibro fog," a specific form of cognitive impairment and fatigue that the campaign directly addresses.
   r/cfs & r/MyalgicEncephalomyelitis
   Reaches users with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, for whom low-energy tracking solutions are a primary need.
   r/migraine & r/Allergies
   Targets users focused on identifying specific triggers for flare-ups, aligning with the "Pattern Discovery" ad group.
   r/LongCOVID
   Reaches a growing community of patients like the "Emily" persona who are actively tracking symptoms to understand a new and complex condition.
   With a clear picture of who we are targeting and where to find them, we can now outline the specific ad groups designed to test our core hypotheses.
   3.0 Ad Group 1: The Exhaustion & Brain Fog Hypothesis
   This ad group tests our first core hypothesis: The primary pain point for our users is the sheer exhaustion and cognitive load of traditional symptom tracking, especially during flares. The messaging will focus on empathy and a low-effort solution for those with limited physical and mental energy.
   3.1 Ad Group Details
   • Campaign Objective: Validate the "Exhaustion & Brain Fog" pain point.
   • Key Feature to Highlight: Low-friction, chat-first tracking that takes less than 30 seconds, the "I'm wiped" low-friction mode, and gentle, non-nagging reminders. This approach directly appeals to the "spoonie" community's need to conserve energy.
   3.2 Ad Creatives
3. Ad 1.1 (Spoon Photo):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Spoon_Theory_Photo.png]
   ◦ Headline: Tired of Tracking?
   ◦ Body Copy: For spoonies, tracking symptoms can feel like a full-time job. When your energy is precious, every task costs a spoon. We get it. ChronicLife is designed to protect your bandwidth. Our check-in takes less than 30 seconds. Stop spending spoons on tracking, and start saving them for living.
4. Ad 1.2 (Headline Test):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Spoon_Theory_Photo.png]
   ◦ Headline: Tracking for Foggy Minds.
   ◦ Body Copy: Living with brain fog feels like having "a rock in my head." Your inner voice is quiet, and remembering details is a battle. ChronicLife acts as your second brain. It gently logs your symptoms, even on your worst days, so you have a clear record when memory fails. No more struggling to remember—we'll handle that for you.
   This ad group directly addresses the daily friction of being sick, setting the stage for the next hypothesis, which tackles the external challenge of communicating that sickness to others.
   4.0 Ad Group 2: The Doctor Mistrust Hypothesis
   This ad group tests our second core hypothesis: The most significant user frustration stems from feeling dismissed by doctors and being unable to communicate their symptoms effectively. The messaging validates this frustration and positions the app as a tool for empowerment and advocacy.
   4.1 Ad Group Details
   • Campaign Objective: Validate the "Doctor Mistrust" pain point.
   • Key Feature to Highlight: The "Doctor Pack" export feature, which creates "clinician-shaped" summaries with graphs and structured narratives. This feature directly counters the problem of doctors ignoring patient-generated diaries or logs.
   4.2 Ad Creatives
5. Ad 2.1 (Focus on Proof):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Doctor_Pack_Mockup.png]
   ◦ Headline: Make Your Doctor Listen.
   ◦ Body Copy: Tired of being told it's just "stress"? ChronicLife helps you provide proof when memory fails. It turns your daily check-ins into a clinician-shaped summary with clear graphs and structured symptom narratives—the kind of objective data that moves a conversation forward. Walk into your next appointment with data, not just a diary.
6. Ad 2.2 (Focus on Preparation):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Doctor_Pack_Mockup.png]
   ◦ Headline: Stop Forgetting Symptoms.
   ◦ Body Copy: Brain fog and "chemo brain" can make you forget important details the moment you're in the doctor's office. The app's "Appointment Prep Mode" organizes everything you need: what helped, what worsened, and key changes since your last visit. Stop leaving appointments feeling like you forgot something critical.
   Ad Group-Level Targeting
   • Keywords: doctor summary, appointment prep, symptom log, advocate for yourself, unexplained symptoms, get diagnosis, doctor appointment, medical records
   • Communities: r/ChronicIllness, r/BrainFog, r/LongCOVID, r/POTS
   This group focuses on the external validation users seek. The final ad group shifts the focus inward, to the personal journey of understanding one's own health.
   5.0 Ad Group 3: The Pattern Discovery Hypothesis
   This ad group tests our third core hypothesis: A user's primary motivation is a deep, personal desire to understand the root causes of their symptoms and identify the hidden triggers that dictate their quality of life. The messaging will appeal to the "health detective" mindset.
   5.1 Ad Group Details
   • Campaign Objective: Validate the "Pattern Discovery" pain point.
   • Key Feature to Highlight: The app's "Insight" engine, which helps users run "Focus hypothesis" experiments (e.g., "How does X impact Y?"). It automatically checks for correlations and lag effects, such as discovering that "worst brain fog episodes came 24-48 hours after digestive flare-ups."
   5.2 Ad Creatives
7. Ad 3.1 (Focus on Clarity):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Pattern_Discovery_UI.png]
   ◦ Headline: Unravel Your Patterns.
   ◦ Body Copy: Gentle, daily tracking can reveal connections your own mind misses. Discover how certain combinations of foods trigger reactions only when eaten together, or how a slight change in sleep impacts next-day pain. ChronicLife helps you find the clues hidden in your daily life.
8. Ad 3.2 (Focus on Prediction):
   ◦ Creative: [ASSET: Pattern_Discovery_UI.png]
   ◦ Headline: Predict Your Next Flare.
   ◦ Body Copy: What if you could anticipate your next flare instead of being blindsided? By logging your symptoms in just seconds a day, ChronicLife helps you discover your personal triggers. Start connecting the dots and gain a sense of control over your health.
   Ad Group-Level Targeting
   • Keywords: symptom triggers, brain fog causes, flare patterns, food sensitivity, IBS tracker, migraine triggers, correlation, symptom tracker
   • Communities: r/migraine, r/Allergies, r/cfs, r/IBS, r/Fibromyalgia
   With the creative for all three hypotheses developed, the next step is to define the budget and timeline for deploying this experiment.
   6.0 Budget Allocation & Timeline
   The budget and timeline are structured to ensure statistically relevant data is collected efficiently across all three experimental ad groups. The approach prioritizes consistency and duration over a high daily spend to mitigate anomalies and capture a representative sample of user behavior.
   6.1 Budget Allocation
   The $100 budget will be allocated evenly across the three ad groups to ensure each hypothesis receives an equal test.
   Ad Group
   Hypothesis
   Budget Allocation
   Ad Group 1
   Exhaustion & Brain Fog
   $33
   Ad Group 2
   Doctor Mistrust
   $33
   Ad Group 3
   Pattern Discovery
   $34
   Total
   $100
   6.2 Timeline
   The campaign will run using the "$10 for 10 days" structure. A 10-day duration is optimal for a validation test, as it allows the ads to be shown on different days of the week, capturing a wider range of user behaviors, moods, and mindsets (e.g., a weekday versus a weekend). The total spend will be $10 per day, distributed across all three ad groups.
   Now that the experiment is fully structured, we can define how its results will be measured and translated into action.
   7.0 Success Metrics & Analysis Plan
   The true outcome of this campaign is not a specific number of users, but a clear, data-backed direction for the product and future marketing efforts. Success is defined by the clarity we gain, which will de-risk and focus our subsequent investments of time and capital.
   7.1 Defining a "Win"
9. Primary Metric - CTR: The ad group with the highest Click-Through Rate (CTR) will be declared the winner. This metric is the purest indicator that the ad's core message resonated most strongly with the target audience and successfully identified their most pressing "hair on fire" problem.
10. Secondary Metric - Waitlist Conversion: The number of users who sign up for the waitlist after clicking through to the landing page will be tracked as a secondary indicator of interest. While CTR measures the resonance of the problem, waitlist conversion indicates the perceived value of the proposed solution.
    7.2 Post-Campaign Action Plan
    The results of "The Clarity Experiment" will be used to guide three key areas of the business:
11. Product Prioritization: The winning hypothesis will directly influence the product roadmap.
    ◦ If Ad Group 1 (Exhaustion) wins, we will double down on simplifying the UI and reducing all friction in the onboarding and daily logging flow.
    ◦ If Ad Group 2 (Doctor Mistrust) wins, we will prioritize building out the "Doctor Pack" feature and exploring potential EHR integration.
    ◦ If Ad Group 3 (Pattern Discovery) wins, we will focus engineering resources on enhancing the "Pattern Recognition" engine and its underlying algorithms.
12. Future Marketing: The headline and body copy from the winning ad group will become the foundation for the next, larger ad campaign. As dictated by the "Magician's Choice" mental model, this ensures our next marketing spend is focused on a message that has already been proven to resonate with our target audience.
13. Learning & Iteration: We will analyze the performance of individual ads within each group to understand nuances in language and imagery. For example, did Make Your Doctor Listen. outperform Stop Forgetting Symptoms.? These micro-insights will provide valuable lessons for all future creative development, refining our brand voice and messaging strategy. These findings will be documented in a concise 'Creative Insights Brief' to guide all future messaging development.
