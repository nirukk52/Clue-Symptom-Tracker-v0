### Locking Q1 (the base buckets)

**Best approach for your 6×5 matrix:**
**Q1 = “What outcome hurts most?”** (the _Y_ you’ll track daily)
**Q2 = “What do you think drives it?”** (the _X_ you’ll test as a focus hypothesis)
This matches your “fast check-in + future patterns + doctor-trust” direction.

#### Recommended Q1 (5 options + Other)

1. **Pain that won’t ease up** (joint / nerve / body pain)
2. **Energy crashes / fatigue / brain fog**
3. **Gut / IBS chaos** (bloating, urgency, discomfort)
4. **Headaches / migraines**
5. **Sleep that’s wrecking me** (insomnia, unrefreshing sleep)
6. **Something else / multiple things**

**Why this wins:** it’s stigma-light, broad, and every choice maps cleanly to a single “today score” metric + a 7–14 day pattern promise (without asking for diagnoses). It also directly answers the #1 retention killer: tracking must feel effortless.

### The “bucket” definitions (what you store internally)

- **Bucket = primary_outcome_domain**: `pain | energy | gut | headache | sleep | other`
- **Secondary tag (optional later)**: `multi_condition=true` if they pick “Something else / multiple things”
- **Daily anchor metric** (drives charts + forecasts):

  - pain → pain_severity
  - energy → energy_level / crash_risk
  - gut → gut_severity
  - headache → headache_severity
  - sleep → sleep_quality
  - other → user_chosen_metric (picked on screen 4 widget)

### Two viable alternatives (if you want a different “vibe”)

**Alt A — More “symptom cluster” (broader, but slightly heavier):**
Pain, Fatigue, GI, Mood, Sleep, Other.
Tradeoff: “Mood” can reduce sign-ups for some audiences; still useful long-term.

**Alt B — “Job-to-be-done” (marketing-forward, weaker baseline):**
Predict flares, Find triggers, Prevent crashes, Prep for doctor, Quick log, Other.
Tradeoff: harder to derive the single daily outcome metric cleanly.

If you go with the **recommended Q1**, Q2 naturally becomes “Which suspect should we test first?” and you get your **30 Q3 prompts** as _X→Y_ focus hypotheses (exactly what your product promises).

\n\n**Q1: If we pick your recommended Q1 buckets, what should the 5 universal “suspect drivers” in Q2 be so every combo becomes an X→Y focus hypothesis?**\n\n

\n\n**Q2: For the “Something else / multiple things” bucket, do you want a mini-picker on Screen 2 to route them into one of the 5 main outcomes anyway?**\n\n

\n\n**Q3: Should Screen 3 log only 1 outcome + 1 driver (ultra-fast), or 1 outcome + 2 drivers (slightly richer signal) for better forecasts?**\n\n
