## Hero Images

### hero_endo_pain_v1 ⏳ Testing

**Campaign:** endo_pain_v1
**Status:** In use
**Results:** TBD

**Prompt:**

```
Vertical and horizontal versions of a modern, calming mobile-app hero image for a chat-first symptom tracker.

Scene: a hand holding a phone showing a clean screen that reads: 'Track symptoms without draining your energy.' Below it, smaller text: '20-second check-ins • Flare Mode • Doctor-ready export'.

Visual style: warm cream background, soft purple + peach accents, minimal gradients, gentle shadows, premium fintech-like clarity.

Include a subtle card UI showing 'How does my Sleep impact my Pain?'

Keep typography perfectly legible, centered, no distortions. No medical imagery, no hospitals, no stock-photo look.

Ultra clean, product-marketing aesthetic, high resolution.
```
