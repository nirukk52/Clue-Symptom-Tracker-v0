## Quick Comparison

| App                  | Strengths              | Weaknesses                   | Our Advantage                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Bearable             | Comprehensive tracking | Complex, overwhelming        | 20-second simplicity         |
| Flaredown            | Community-focused      | Dated UI, slow               | Modern, personal assistant   |
| Daylio               | Simple, habit-like     | Not chronic-illness specific | Flare mode, doctor export    |
| Symptom Tracker apps | Specific conditions    | Siloed, no insights          | Multi-condition, AI insights |
| Spreadsheets         | Full control           | Time-consuming, no analysis  | Automatic patterns           |

## Why They Fail

### Problem 1: Too Complex

Most apps try to track everything, resulting in:

- 5+ minute check-ins
- Form fatigue
- Abandoned after 2 weeks

**Our answer:** 20-second check-ins, flare mode, smart defaults

### Problem 2: No Insights

Raw data without meaning:

- "You logged 47 entries this month"
- No pattern recognition
- Users left to analyze themselves

**Our answer:** Evidence-backed insights with receipts

### Problem 3: Doctor-Useless Output

Data dumps that doctors ignore:

- Spreadsheet exports
- Too much information
- No summary or highlights

**Our answer:** Doctor-designed summaries that scan in 30 seconds

### Problem 4: Bad Day Blindspot

Same interface whether you're thriving or barely functional:

- Complex forms on flare days
- No accommodation for brain fog
- "Tracking is a luxury" mindset

**Our answer:** Flare mode—one tap when you're not okay

## Competitive Messaging

| When They Say            | We Say                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| "Comprehensive tracking" | "Track without the effort" |
| "Detailed insights"      | "No vibes. Only receipts." |
| "Export your data"       | "Doctor-ready summaries"   |
| "Daily logging"          | "20 seconds. That's it."   |
