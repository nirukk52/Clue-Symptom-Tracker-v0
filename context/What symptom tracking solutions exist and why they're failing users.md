# What symptom tracking solutions exist and why they're failing users

The Medical Tracking app landscape is evolving rapidly with a remarkable 43% increase in downloads in 2024[1], yet chronic illness patients consistently report that existing solutions fall short of their needs. Despite this growth, users across multiple chronic illness communities express deep frustration with tracking tools that collect data without meaningful insights, demand too much time and energy, and fail to help them understand their health patterns or communicate effectively with doctors.

The core problem isn't lack of options—it's that most solutions approach symptom tracking from a technology-first rather than patient-first perspective. Users report that most apps "just collect data without connecting the dots or helping me understand what's going on"[2], leaving patients feeling blindsided rather than empowered. This disconnect between what apps offer and what patients actually need drives widespread abandonment, with the average app losing 80% of its users within the first month[3].

## The crowded landscape of specialized versus comprehensive solutions

The symptom tracking market divides into two main categories. Specialized apps focus intensely on one aspect of health offering deep functionality for specific conditions, while comprehensive platforms integrate multiple tracking features to provide a complete picture of health[4]. Both approaches have significant limitations that frustrate users.

**Specialized condition-specific apps** include popular names like Migraine Buddy for migraines, Bearable for symptom-centric tracking, Daylio for mood tracking, and eMoods for bipolar disorder. While Daylio's simplicity appeals to many through quick daily entries with mood icons, it can leave users wanting more depth and lacks the ability to correlate mood changes with other health factors like sleep quality, medication adherence, or physical symptoms[4]. Users appreciate Bearable's focus on identifying triggers and patterns in symptom flares, but this narrow focus can sometimes create tunnel vision where users become overly focused on symptoms without considering the broader health picture[4].

**Comprehensive platforms** like CareClinic, Visible, and Guava attempt to track multiple health aspects simultaneously. Visible has been used for over a year by some users for tracking pacing points and heart rate, particularly popular among chronic illness communities[5]. Guava allows users to track heart rate, HRV, steps, sodium, water, blood pressure, and sleep with the ease of connecting a watch and health apps[6]. However, these comprehensive apps often overwhelm users with complexity and setup requirements.

## Manual tracking: Paper, spreadsheets, and the analog holdouts

Despite the app explosion, many chronic illness patients continue using manual methods. One fibromyalgia patient uses a 9 by 11 inch datebook to track medications, food, liquids, personal care, activity level, notable symptoms, and urination/defecation, also noting when they wake up, sleep during the day, and go lights out at night[7]. Others use color coding on paper calendars with in-depth explanations in notebooks, finding it "way easier to see the color codes pop out at me on paper, instead of info buried in a bunch of dumb submenus in an app" and appreciating doing something un-digital[8].

Some patients track on paper and spreadsheets but report "it got out of hand quickly"[9]. One chronic sinusitis patient manually tracked symptoms for 3+ years using spreadsheets and paper journals but "finally got frustrated enough to build my own app"[10]. The analog approach offers simplicity and no subscription fees, but lacks easy ways to compile and compare data, though users don't have to pay monthly fees—just once a year purchase of a datebook[7].

## The energy paradox: When tracking becomes another burden

The single most cited complaint from chronic illness patients is that symptom tracking requires more energy than they have to give. Users report "I lose energy to track symptoms except for when they're severe or when they change"[8], while others admit "I haven't been able to track my stuff since over a year because I've kept on survival each day and haven't had the energy to do further"[8].

Patients describe tracking as "overwhelming" where "some days it feels impossible to remember everything, and it can be really frustrating"[11]. One user specifically abandoned Bearable because "it took far too long to log stuff and I got bored after 2 weeks, and it hurt my thumbs"[12]. This creates a cruel irony: the patients who most need tracking are precisely those with the least energy to maintain it.

The burden intensifies when tracking multiple symptoms, making it "harder bc I need to remember to do it" and "if you have a lot of symptoms you are tracking, it can feel tedious to log each one"[7]. The friction between needing data and lacking capacity to collect it drives many patients to abandon tracking entirely.

## The frustration of talking to walls: Doctors who don't engage with patient data

Even when patients overcome the energy barrier to track symptoms consistently, many discover their doctors won't engage with the data. Doctors' reactions to detailed symptom logs are mixed—some dive right in and carefully look at recordings, while others bluntly say they won't read that[7]. One pain specialist patient did "a pain diary with cool pictures to circle where the pain was and wrote down what was happening and pain levels" but the specialist "didn't even look at it," leaving the patient "just felt overwhelmed reading back on it"[13].

This disconnect creates profound discouragement. Patients wonder "if I take this big diary to my GP, I'm not sure if even then they'll take me seriously"[7]. The fear that extensive tracking efforts will be dismissed or ignored by medical professionals becomes a significant barrier to starting or continuing symptom tracking.

## Complex features and paywalls that alienate users

Apps frequently hide essential features behind paywalls, frustrating users who discover basic functionality requires payment. With Shotsy, "a lot of people expect features eg charts to be free, only to find out they are paid features"[14]. Users complain that with MeAgain "can't get past the paywall and see anything" while with Shotsy it's "clean, but limited on charts" and "half of them want money before you can see anything"[14].

Users express desire for apps with "no subscriptions, no ads, no account needed, no trying to sell your data" noting that "the similar apps I have seen always upsell something"[12]. The subscription fatigue is real—chronic illness patients already face significant medical expenses and resist adding yet another monthly fee.

Technical problems compound user frustration. Shotsy's "graphs sometimes glitch, and it doesn't handle 'zeros' well on side effects which is annoyin because it skews the data and makes mild symptoms look worse than they are"[14]. When apps designed to bring clarity instead create confusion through technical failures, users abandon them quickly.

## The missing connections: Apps that don't reveal patterns

Perhaps the most significant gap is apps' failure to help users understand *why* their symptoms occur. Patients express that "most apps I've used don't really help—they just collect data without connecting the dots or helping me understand what's going on" and "I don't need another tracker, I need something that actually makes sense of my symptoms"[2].

Mood tracking apps lack "the ability to correlate mood changes with other health factors like sleep quality, medication adherence, or physical symptoms"[4]. Users need integration that "reveals connections between mood and other health metrics that isolated mood tracking might miss," discovering "correlations between their mood patterns and sleep quality, medication timing, or dietary choices" to get "actionable insights rather than just data visualization"[4].

The problem extends beyond mental health tracking. One fibromyalgia patient found "nothing was trackable, everything just happened when ever it wanted with no traceable cause or effect" leading them to give up after going "3 months without flares and then had them week after week"[13], ultimately deciding to "just live each day now."

## The psychological toll: When tracking increases health anxiety

Some healthcare providers warn that excessive symptom tracking can worsen symptoms by increasing health anxiety. A pelvic floor therapist told one patient "that with chronic pain disorders and things like fibromyalgia that I shouldn't be tracking my symptoms so closely, as it then increases my focus on the pain, and could in turn, worsen my pain and or symptoms—health anxiety = worse health"[13].

This creates a difficult balance for patients. The same patient later realized "not tracking things like my exercise and my meds and my symptoms is just making me blind"[13], caught between the need for data and fear of worsening their condition through excessive monitoring. Others agree that "with fibro there can be do many symptoms that it would be too easy to hyper focus on them all"[13].

## What chronic illness patients actually need but aren't getting

Several critical gaps emerge from user feedback. First, **better mood and pain separation**. Users want to "track things like mood and pain/symptoms separately" because "in the apps I've used they're usually just one item" but "sometimes my pain is bad, but because something good happened/I did something fun, my mood will be fine—my mood and pain aren't always the same"[12].

Second, **meaningful simplicity**. The consistent refrain is "it needs to be simple"[12], but simplicity that still captures essential information and reveals patterns. Third, **unified health record keeping**. Patients dealing with multiple chronic conditions across different specialists report "my health records are scattered in multiple hospital portals" creating "a pain point of unified health record keeping"[15].

Fourth, **cross-referencing capabilities**. Users want "things to track meals/activities and a way to cross-reference it with your pain, to see if/what food/drinks/activities affect your symptoms"[12]. Finally, **partner sharing features**. Some want apps where they can "get your partner to pair with your account" because "updating each other all the time on these things can be draining"[16].

## The trust crisis and data privacy concerns

Recent controversies highlight growing concerns about data privacy and company trustworthiness. Visible founder apologized after "we got something wrong" when "members of this community raised concerns over the weekend that certain trials appearing in the central registry were authored by researchers whose views are actively harmful to this community, in particular, a trial being run by Trudie Chalder"[17]. Some users worry about "giving health data to a third-party app without clarity on how it's stored or used"[14], particularly as apps grow rapidly.

## The abandonment cycle: Why users quit

The research reveals clear patterns in why users abandon tracking tools. The typical trajectory shows "millions of people download habit tracking apps every January" with "the first week feels promising, the second week gets harder" and "by week three, most have quietly abandoned their tracker altogether"[3]. Simple gamification features like "point systems and basic streaks provide temporary motivation but lack the depth to create lasting engagement—when the novelty wears off, usually within weeks, users abandon the app and their habits disappear with it"[3].

The fundamental issue is that most apps "depend on you remembering to open them, log your habits, and stay motivated" but "research on self-control depletion shows that willpower gets weaker throughout the day—when apps require discipline to work, they're fighting against human nature instead of working with it"[3].

## Conclusion: A market failing its most vulnerable users

The symptom tracking market presents a paradox: explosive growth in downloads and revenue alongside widespread user dissatisfaction and abandonment. The industry has optimized for initial adoption rather than sustained value, creating tools that burden rather than empower patients already struggling with limited energy and complex medical needs. Until developers prioritize meaningful insights over data collection, reduce friction rather than add features, and build for the reality of chronic illness rather than idealized user behavior, the gap between what exists and what patients need will continue to drive cycles of hope and abandonment.
