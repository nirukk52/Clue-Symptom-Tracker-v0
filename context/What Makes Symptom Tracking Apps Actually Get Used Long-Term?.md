# What Makes Symptom Tracking Apps Actually Get Used Long-Term?

A median of 70% of users discontinued health app use within the first 100 days[1], revealing a critical challenge: most tracking apps fail to maintain user engagement beyond initial enthusiasm. Incorporating behavioral science design in an ePRO platform resulted in further increase in adherence in a longitudinal study[2], demonstrating that strategic design choices profoundly impact sustained use. This matters because effective symptom tracking requires consistent data collection over time—spotty engagement undermines clinical utility and wastes development resources. The backstory reveals that while gamification was used by 64% of mobile applications[3], this alone doesn't guarantee retention. Research shows users need specific combinations of features addressing both practical barriers and psychological needs. The implications extend beyond individual apps: understanding what drives long-term adherence could transform how we design digital health interventions, making them as effective as in-person care while remaining scalable.

## The critical first 100 days separate success from abandonment

A curvilinear pattern of app abandonment emerged, with sharper abandonment soon after acquisition, followed by a slowing rate of abandonment over time[1]. This pattern holds profound implications for app design—if users don't find value quickly, they won't stick around to discover it later. The first week marks an important time point in continuing usage of the app, as many studies reported the largest drop-off in usage after the first week of the study, regardless of study duration[4].

The speed of abandonment varies by health domain. Apps focusing on alcohol and smoking exhibited faster abandonment, and physical activity and mental health exhibited longer usage durations[1]. This suggests that **behavior change complexity matters**—addictive behaviors may require different engagement strategies than habit formation. Most studies reported that 50% or more of users had abandoned their app within the first 100 days of initial use, with a median abandonment rate at 100 days of approximately 70%[1].

Yet abandonment isn't always failure. Entering a state of transition where users no longer needed to track their data or had achieved their goals led to user abandonment[1]. When a smoking cessation app successfully helps someone quit, reduced engagement becomes a success metric rather than a problem. This paradox reveals the need for nuanced retention goals aligned with clinical outcomes rather than engagement metrics alone.

## Value must be visible within days, not weeks

Users need rapid evidence that tracking serves their interests. The most engaging mobile interventions provided participants with the ability to view and/or interact with their health data[4], creating immediate feedback loops. Providing results and information tailored to an individual's gender, needs, characteristics, and interests has been shown to both produce more online activity and increase retention[4].

Three categories of value delivery emerge from the research:

**Diaries and feedback** prove most engaging when they close the loop between tracking and insight. Meal, blood pressure, medications, and weight loggings, visualization of participant's health data over time, personalized feedback based on questionnaires or from health care providers[4] all demonstrated higher engagement. The key isn't just collecting data—it's showing users what that data means.

**Coaching and education** connect tracking to actionable guidance. Goal-setting tools, health coach/provider messaging, personalized content, educational modules or lessons[4] helped users understand why tracking matters and what to do with the information. Apps that included a coaching element, either from paraprofessionals, other participants, or the research study team, reported that this social support was critical for maintaining engagement throughout[5].

**Reminders** when properly calibrated, not intrusive. Reminder texts and/or app notifications at a limited frequency[4] supported engagement, but reminders that were too frequent[4] actually hindered participation. Users were most likely to engage with the app within 24 hours if prompted midday on the weekend. It is clear that reminders or other feedback through notifications was a supportive element for producing more engagement[5].

## Friction elimination outweighs feature richness

Reducing participant friction when logging in to an ePRO platform can promote retention. Longitudinally, participants were most willing to continue using platforms with lower-friction authentication methods, such as face or touch ID, in comparison to needing to remember and repeatedly enter a username and password[2]. This finding challenges the assumption that more security equals better engagement—instead, it suggests that **perceived security with minimal effort** represents the optimal balance.

Users reported abandoning apps due to phone compatibility issues, while others described abandoning an app after a technical error and resultant data loss, and due to the need to create an account before using an app[1]. Each additional step before value delivery increases abandonment risk. Design and usability concerns contributed to abandonment, particularly where the apps were considered confusing to use[1].

The research reveals a **simplicity paradox**: Intervention designs that fail to meet a threshold of mHealth expectations will be dismissed as less usable or beneficial[6], yet Individuals who download health apps have shared expectations for features that should be there, as well as where these features should appear. Meeting these expectations can improve app evaluations and encourage use[6]. Users want comprehensive functionality delivered through intuitive interfaces—they reject both bare-bones tracking tools and feature-bloated apps with poor navigation.

Features fell into 4 unique categories based on attention and predicted use, including essential features with high predicted use and attention, flashy features with high attention but lower predicted use, functional features with modest attention and low use, and mundane features with low attention and use[6]. Developers must prioritize essential and functional features while minimizing mundane elements that clutter interfaces.

## Personalization and autonomy support trump generic tracking

Participants valued the autonomy supportive features in the Precious app. We identified the following five themes based on the theory-based theme autonomy support: valuing the chance to choose, concern about lack of autonomy, expecting controlling features, autonomous goals, and autonomy supportive feedback[7]. This reveals users want control over their tracking experience, not prescriptive one-size-fits-all approaches.

The motivational interviewing features actively engaged participants in reflecting their outcome goals and reasons for activity, producing several types of change talk and very little sustain talk. The types of change talk identified were desire, need, reasons, ability, commitment, and taking steps toward change[7]. When apps help users articulate their own reasons for tracking rather than imposing external motivations, engagement deepens.

The self-determination theory provides the psychological foundation: Those who successfully maintained regular physical activity reported higher intrinsic and extrinsic motives compared to those who were not regularly active[8]. Both pleasure from the activity itself and connection to personally valued goals drive sustained behavior. Users are more likely to actively engage in the behavior change process if the app addresses their basic psychological needs: supports their autonomy, creates a sense of relatedness, and provides them with experiences of competence and self-efficacy[7].

## Gamification works—but only with behavioral science foundations

59% reported positive, 41% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes[9]. Gamification shows genuine promise, but implementation quality matters enormously. Game elements used most commonly included goal-setting, social influences, and challenges, while less common elements included points and levels[3].

The evidence reveals **three gamification principles** for sustained engagement:

First, gamification must align with intrinsic motivation. No applications incorporated behavioral economics principles specified in the study[3], representing a missed opportunity. Approach motivation is the key driver of the individual process of behavior change until a new behavior is maintained and assertion motivation takes over[10]. Game elements should initially spark excitement (approach) then transition to comfortable habits (assertion).

Second, social elements require careful implementation. Social forums or integration with social media[4] actually hindered participation in many studies. Yet social influences[3] ranked among the most common successful elements. The difference lies in **optional versus mandatory** social features—users appreciate the ability to share but resist forced social interactions.

Third, rewards must feel meaningful, not manipulative. Participants assigned to the DCH app group experienced behavioral science–driven motivational elements related to reward and identity formation throughout their study journey. There was no homolog to this feature in any other tested platform[2]. The DCH app group had greater adherence than all other arms[2], demonstrating that **theory-driven** rather than superficial gamification produces results.

## Progress visualization and pattern recognition create stickiness

Visualization of participant's health data over time[4] emerged as a key engagement driver. Users want to see not just current values but trends and patterns. Features with summary graphs or statics were also expected by many, with a center placement expectation[6].

The power of visualization extends beyond aesthetics. Users are encouraged to think about the good experiences they have had and might have with physical activity, hoping to remind them of times they have felt competent[7]. When apps connect current data to past successes and future possibilities, they transform tracking from a chore into a narrative of progress.

Behavior change techniques can be clustered based on motivation and reward processes according to their functional mechanisms into facilitating, boosting and nudging[10]. Visualization primarily serves the boosting function—strengthening internal reflective resources by showing users their own capability through accumulated evidence.

## Daily integration matters more than comprehensive features

Burdensome data entry[1] consistently emerged as an abandonment trigger. Annoyance from notifications[1] similarly drove users away. The challenge lies in maintaining presence without becoming burdensome—apps must fit into existing routines rather than demanding new ones.

Individuals tend to carry phones with them and keep them switched on continuously, use apps repeatedly for brief moments between other activities, and value this possibility for ubiquitous support[7]. Successful tracking apps embrace this micro-interaction pattern. The Fogg Behavior Model shows that three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing[11].

For symptom tracking, this means: reducing entry time to under 30 seconds (Ability), connecting tracking to existing habits like morning coffee or bedtime (Prompt), and showing immediate value like a completed streak or insight (Motivation). Apps that require five minutes of focused attention multiple times daily fight against human nature.

## Clinical population and compensation dramatically shift retention

Participants with a clinical condition of interest were 4 times more likely to stay in the study than those who did not. Moreover, participants who were compensated were 10 times more likely to stay in the study than those who were not compensated[5]. These findings reveal that **personal relevance** fundamentally changes engagement dynamics.

Any participant is more likely to not be retained than to be retained[5], establishing the baseline challenge. Yet mHealth apps that were focused on a niche or highly motivated group of users tended to be more successful in engaging participants over the course of the study. For example, mHealth apps created to support smoking cessation for adult smokers were more likely to be successful when participants were already highly motivated to stop smoking[5].

This creates a design tension: apps targeting prevention face steeper engagement challenges than those targeting active disease management. The solution may lie in reframing prevention tracking as personally relevant through different frames—not "prevent future diabetes" but "maintain energy to play with grandchildren" or "optimize athletic performance."

## The features users actually abandon

Understanding what doesn't work proves as valuable as identifying success factors. 22 unique reasons were identified, which were arranged into 12 subcategories and 6 overarching abandonment categories: technical and functional issues, privacy concerns, poor user experience, content and features, time and financial costs, and evolving user needs and goals[1].

Participants reported lack of desired content and features contributed to them abandoning their apps. This included a lack of personalization, accountability, and other desired features, lacking variety, insufficient knowledge content, and a lack of professional advice from experts[1]. The pattern reveals users abandon apps that feel generic, incomplete, or disconnected from clinical guidance.

Some users reported downloading several potential apps, identifying the most suitable, and uninstalling the rest[1]. This "app shopping" behavior suggests users actively search for optimal solutions—meeting their needs immediately prevents abandonment to competitors.

A feature to "share with friends" was least expected among participants[6], yet many apps emphasize social features. This mismatch between developer priorities and user expectations explains some abandonment. Daily surveys (or redundant surveys)[4] similarly frustrated users who felt their time wasn't respected.

## Conclusion: From tracking tools to behavior change partners

The evidence converges on a clear insight: sustained symptom tracking requires apps that function as **behavior change partners** rather than mere data collection tools. The platform with behavioral science-based motivational features had significantly higher adherence than any other modality in this study, suggesting efficacy for long-term studies[2].

Success demands three simultaneous accomplishments: eliminating friction to make tracking effortless, delivering personalized value within days to justify continued effort, and supporting psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The Precious app takes a unique approach to engage users in the behavior change process by targeting both reflective and spontaneous processes. It allows motivational interviewing in a mobile form, supports psychological needs with relational techniques, and targets intrinsic motivation with gamified elements. The motivational interviewing approach shows promise, but the impact of its interactive features and tailored feedback needs to be studied over time[7].

The research reveals that long-term adherence isn't a feature checklist—it's a design philosophy that respects user autonomy, provides immediate value, integrates seamlessly into daily life, and evolves with changing user needs. Apps that accomplish this transform from abandoned downloads into essential health management tools.
