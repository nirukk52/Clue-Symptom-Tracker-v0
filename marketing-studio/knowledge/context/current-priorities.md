# Current Priorities

What the marketing agent should focus on right now.

_Last updated: 2024-12-28_

## Active Focus

### Primary: Reddit Campaigns for Chronic Illness Communities

**Goal:** Drive waitlist signups through targeted Reddit ads

**Target communities:**

1. r/endometriosis - Pain/fatigue angle ✅ `endo_pain_v1` live
2. r/PCOS - Fatigue/hormone angle
3. r/ChronicIllness - General tracking angle
4. r/Fibromyalgia - Flare tracking angle

**Current campaign:** `endo_pain_v1` (testing)

### Next Up

1. Analyze `endo_pain_v1` results when available
2. Create `pcos_fatigue_v1` campaign
3. Test different angles for endo (flare mode vs energy)

## Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric          | Target | Current |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Click Rate      | > 15%  | TBD     |
| Conversion Rate | > 10%  | TBD     |
| Cost per Signup | < $5   | TBD     |

## Constraints

- **Budget:** Limited, focus on highest-intent communities
- **Brand:** No medical claims, no stock-photo aesthetic
- **Tone:** Empathetic, not salesy

## Campaign Ideas Backlog

| Idea                | Condition | Angle        | Priority |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Flare mode focus    | endo      | flare        | High     |
| Brain fog angle     | longcovid | brainfog     | High     |
| Doctor export focus | chronic   | doctor       | Medium   |
| Testimonial format  | any       | social proof | Medium   |

## Notes

- First campaign establishing baseline performance
- Focus on Pain #1 (fatigue/energy) as primary angle
- Test before scaling to multiple conditions
