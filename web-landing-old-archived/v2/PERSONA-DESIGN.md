## Persona Context

### Meet "Maya" — Our Landing Page Face

**Demographics:**

- **Age:** 38 years old
- **Appearance:** South Asian or Mediterranean features, dark wavy hair (shoulder length), warm skin tone
- **Expression:** Peaceful but present — someone who has learned to live with unpredictability, not defeated by it

**Her Story:**
Maya manages fibromyalgia and long COVID. She's a project manager who had to step back to part-time work. She's not "sick" in the obvious way — she looks healthy, which is part of her struggle. People say "but you look fine" all the time.

**What She Represents:**

- The invisible illness experience — looks healthy, struggles daily
- Intelligence and capability — not a victim, a problem-solver
- Hope without toxic positivity — realistic optimism
- Self-advocacy — taking control of her health data

**Why This Matters for Conversion:**
Users need to see themselves in Maya. She's not:

- A model looking unrealistically healthy
- Someone in a hospital bed (too scary)
- An abstract illustration (too cold)

She IS:

- Someone who could be their friend, sister, coworker
- Visibly managing life, not just surviving
- Looking forward, not down (hope, not despair)
