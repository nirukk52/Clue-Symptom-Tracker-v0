This strategy is designed as a "Pain-Point A/B/C Test." We are not just trying to get installs; we are trying to see which problem users are desperate enough to click on. This tells you which feature to build next.

Campaign Name
Campaign Name: ChronicLife_Validation_Experiment_v1 Strategy: The "Painted Door" Strategy. Budget Split:

Days 1–10 ($10/day): Run all 3 Ad Groups evenly ($3.33/day each). Do not touch them. Let the algorithm learn.

Days 11–15 ($20/day): Kill the two worst-performing Ad Groups. Put the full $20/day into the winner to maximize installs and gather user feedback.

Campaign Ad Group 1: The "Energy Saver" (Validation for: Quick Entry Features)
Hypothesis: The biggest barrier is that users are too tired to track. Objective: Traffic / Conversions (depending on platform, Traffic is safer for small budgets). Target Audience: Interests: Spoon Theory, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia.

Ad 1 (Using your Spoon Photo)

Visual: The photo of the spoon you attached.

Headline: "Tracking shouldn't cost a spoon."

Sub-headline: "Chronic Life takes 20 seconds. Save your energy for living."

Ad 2 (Text/Value Focus)

Visual: Screenshot of the chat interface showing a simple "I'm in pain" message and the bot doing the work.

Headline: "Too tired to journal? Just chat."

Sub-headline: "The first symptom tracker designed for low-energy days."

If this group wins: Your product direction should focus on speed. Polish the "One-tap flare mode" and voice-to-text features.

Campaign Ad Group 2: The "Doctor Advocate" (Validation for: Report Generation)
Hypothesis: The biggest barrier is that doctors don't believe the patient or don't read the logs. Objective: Traffic. Target Audience: Interests: Autoimmune Diseases, Rheumatology, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (folks who see specialists often).

Ad 1 (Outcome Focus)

Visual: A clean, professional PDF summary (from your "Doctor Pack" designs) or a person handing a report to a doctor.

Headline: "Finally, a log your doctor will actually read."

Sub-headline: "Turn your daily symptoms into medical evidence. No more gaslighting."

Ad 2 (Pain Focus)

Visual: A frustrated patient looking at a doctor who is looking at a computer screen.

Headline: "Don't let them say 'it's just anxiety.'"

Sub-headline: "Walk into your next appointment with clear, data-backed proof."

If this group wins: Your product direction should focus on outputs. Prioritize the PDF generation, charts, and "Doctor Speak" translation features.

Campaign Ad Group 3: The "Memory Assistant" (Validation for: Pattern Detection)
Hypothesis: The biggest barrier is "Brain Fog"—users can't remember what triggered a flare. Objective: Traffic. Target Audience: Interests: Long Covid, ADHD in women, Brain Fog.

Ad 1 (Anxiety Focus)

Visual: A blurry image representing brain fog or a calendar with question marks.

Headline: "Brain fog stole your memory. Clue brings it back."

Sub-headline: "We track the patterns so you don't have to."

Ad 2 (Prediction Focus)

Visual: A simple graph showing a spike (Flare) following a specific trigger (e.g., "Poor Sleep").

Headline: "Predict your next flare before it starts."

Sub-headline: "Discover the triggers hiding in your daily routine."

If this group wins: Your product direction should focus on analytics. Prioritize the "Pattern Recognition" engine and correlation algorithms.

Mental Models for this Spend
1. The "Hair on Fire" Model You have $100. You are trying to find out which part of the user's life is "on fire."

Is their hair on fire because they are exhausted? (Group 1)

Is their hair on fire because they are being ignored by doctors? (Group 2)

Is their hair on fire because they are confused/forgetful? (Group 3)

Action: Don't look at Cost Per Install (CPI) alone. Look at Click-Through Rate (CTR). A high CTR means you hit a nerve. That is the feature you build.

2. The "Magician's Choice" In your second phase (the ad campaign you run after this $100), you won't guess what headline to use. You will use the winner of this experiment.

If "Doctor Trust" wins now, your next $500 campaign will be entirely about medical advocacy. You are paying $100 now to save wasting $400 later on the wrong message.

3. The "20-Second Rule" For the creative (especially the spoon ad): Users in your demographic judge energy expenditure instantly.

If the ad looks like it contains a "wall of text," they will scroll past because reading it costs energy.

Keep the visuals simple and the headlines under 7 words. The "Spoon" ad is excellent because it uses visual shorthand—people in the community instantly know what it means without reading.
