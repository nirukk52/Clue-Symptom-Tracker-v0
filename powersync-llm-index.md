- [Renaming a Column on the Client](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/deploying-schema-changes/renaming-a-column-on-the-client.md): Use the same approach as for renaming tables:
- [Renaming a Column on the Server](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/deploying-schema-changes/renaming-a-column-on-the-server.md): Use the `ifnull` function in Sync Rules to output whichever column is available. This would handle both the old and new schema versions:

- [Renaming a Table on the Client](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/deploying-schema-changes/renaming-a-table-on-the-client.md): Pass in a "`schema_version`" or similar parameter from the client, and use this in Sync Rules to use either the old or new table name in the data queries.
- [Renaming a Table on the Server](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/deploying-schema-changes/renaming-a-table-on-the-server.md): The approach here is to have the Sync Rules handle both the old and the new table name during the migration period.

- [Handling Write / Validation Errors](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/handling-write-validation-errors.md): The general approach is that for transient errors (e.g. server or database unavailable), the changes are kept in the client-side upload queue, and retried at 5 second intervals, keeping the original order. In the future it will be possible to control the retry behavior.
