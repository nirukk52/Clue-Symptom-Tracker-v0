pacing vs flare patterns

I have attached the two ads that worked (both were from pattern category) out of the campaign headlines.md attached.

Now we need to dive deeper into the pattern category to finalize the product offering further.

I want three ad groups, each with keywords (refer above for examples and improve on them),

And 3-4 ad headlines per ad group, each testing one hypothesis. Each ad should be followed by the tracking link like above.

A total of 6-9 ads will be run in parallel. I am planning to keep the image of each ad group the same so that the test mainly focuses on headlines.

This is a final test that will decide the core product offering.
