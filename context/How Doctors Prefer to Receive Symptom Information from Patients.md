# How Doctors Prefer to Receive Symptom Information from Patients

Healthcare providers face a critical tension: they need comprehensive symptom data to make accurate clinical decisions, yet operate under severe time constraints that limit their ability to review detailed patient information. Research reveals that the format, timing, and presentation of symptom data profoundly affect whether providers can actually use it—and that current systems often fail on multiple fronts.

## Providers want graphical displays with drill-down capability, not raw data dumps

Physicians reported benefits of PRO data including that it provides more detailed information that may have been missed during the clinical encounter, and it helps provide objective value in patients' trends in pain scores and the functional impact of their chronic pain.[1] However, the format matters enormously. Physicians desired easier access to PRO results and more visualization options, wanting to pull up the PRO graph using "fewer clicks" and to have a variety of data display options that allow providers to "select the representation of data and the interpretation of results in the manner that best works for them".[2]

Participants reported that the ability to sort or summarize data in a descriptive manner, or to graph it in different ways, helped health care professionals to more quickly see patterns in the data patients' generated, and to extrapolate something meaningful from these data.[2] The key insight: providers need **summary visualizations with the ability to access details on demand**, not the reverse.

Health care professionals reported that there might be a need to customize their dashboards, and if the information displayed in a Web-based dashboard could not easily be rearranged to meet user needs, it reduced ease of use and efficiency.[3] One nurse described frustration when she couldn't easily sort patient data: the inability to organize information by her own patients "added time to her tasks."

## Temporal patterns matter more than single data points

Providers emphasized the value of temporal data regarding when symptoms first emerge and how they progress over time, as well as the potential value of concurrent activity or other data about daily activities and functioning.[4] This longitudinal view provides context that single measurements cannot.

In one study, a physician noted that weight data "turned out to be a great proxy for someone's health status with Crohn's because it actually fluctuates significantly week-to-week... it's amazing the things you can catch on a Wi-Fi scale if you step on it every day. And the providers were really enthusiastic about that data, especially because they only see weigh-ins like every three months or so. And so this allowed, I think, patients and providers to have a really clear starting point into sort of the ebb and flow of how things were actually progressing."[5]

## Time constraints create a fundamental barrier

Clinician time constraints were among the barriers that prevent doctors from engaging with patient symptom tracking.[1] This isn't mere preference—it's structural reality. Providers were expected to review PRO results to identify patient issues, but many physicians did not do so routinely, considering PRO review to be time-consuming, disruptive, and a distraction from discussion with the patient.[2] One oncologist stated directly: "When you've got 20 min with the patient before the next one is in the room, it needs to flow, not be interrupted".[2]

Physicians wanted the functionality to automatically insert PRO results into the clinical note, in conjunction with a description of the meaning of the score, which would help them to identify patient issues "within a few seconds" and save time for the clinic visit.[2]

## Providers need actionable data with clear clinical thresholds

A recurring theme across studies: Barriers mainly stemmed from a lack of actionable data, workflow disruption, technical issues, and a lack of incentives.[2] Physicians seldom acted upon PROs due to a lack of actionable data: "PROs have only been validated against legacy tools, but is there a way that we can develop patient trajectories for common conditions?"[2]

One nurse describes how a protocol guided her actions: "I know definitively if they were in the red zone all the time, I would call them. Sometimes I'd even just make sure they were using their medications correctly, because sometimes you'd see where they were using rescue meds, but they weren't using their controller medications."[5] The key: clear thresholds that trigger specific actions.

## The "redundancy problem": providers already ask these questions

Oncologists regarded PROs as redundant because they "already asked patients things like fatigue and distress" in routine visits.[2] 78% of interviewed physicians reported that they asked similar questions to the patient questionnaires on their own, and 33% reported that they still needed to confirm all the questionnaire data with the patient.[1]

This reveals a critical insight: symptom tracking data doesn't replace conversation—it should *prepare* for better conversation. Physicians emphasized the importance of PROMs in improving quality of life, managing emotional distress and addressing spiritual needs, particularly in end-of-life care.[6] The value comes from having the data available to contextualize and deepen the discussion, not to eliminate it.

## Structured data beats unstructured narratives for clinical use

Symptom data is not consistently recorded or defined in EHR systems, which impedes physicians' access to information they need to provide accurate, timely diagnoses. Because EHRs lack structured fields for symptom data, they are often not recorded in a consistent or shareable manner.[7]

In one study on clinical documentation, the most preferred format for History of Present Illness was story (coherent paragraph), followed by list without categories and list with categories. The most preferred format for Assessment and Plan was list with categories, followed by story and list without categories.[8] This suggests physicians want **narrative context for understanding symptoms, but structured organization for actionable information**.

## The eight characteristics framework that helps patients communicate effectively

One of the things professors teach medical students is the eight characteristics of a symptom, including: where is your pain or numbness, how long have you had the symptom, if it's something intermittent how often does it happen and how long does it last, is it gradually getting worse/better/staying the same, what were you doing when you first noticed the symptom, are any other symptoms associated with this one, what is the "quality" of the symptom (what does it feel like), what is the "quantity" of the symptom (how bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10), what aggravates the symptom, and what alleviates the symptom.[9]

Basically, physicians want to know a patient's chief complaint, "and then we want a paragraph – not six paragraphs and not a novel – and in that paragraph you need to tell the doctor these eight things."[9]

## Memory problems and recall bias undermine verbal reporting

Memory problems were the most commonly cited symptom to interfere with accurate reporting and made it particularly difficult for patients to wait until their doctor's appointment to bring up symptoms. One patient remarked: "They asked what's going on. Is the nausea bad, this and that but you're getting this whitewashed version, because I forgot what happened 10 days ago." Another noted: "I really should have written more down because chemo brain is very real and you'd forget."[4]

This is where symptom tracking becomes genuinely valuable—not as a replacement for clinical judgment, but as an aide-mémoire that captures temporal patterns that patients cannot reliably recall.

## Barriers that prevent engagement: it's mostly workflow and integration

Physician, patient and technical-level barriers were discussed, including that the physicians still need to confirm the questionnaire data with the patients, low patient completion rates and clinician time constraints.[1] 

Providers found PRO review to be time-consuming, disruptive, and redundant because they "already asked patients things like fatigue and distress" in routine visits.[2]

Perhaps the major barrier identified is the lack of a clear place in the EHR for entering PROs generated between visits where the physician would likely notice them. A recent note is one possible location, but not all physicians look there before each visit.[3]

Health care professionals reported wanting data integrated in the EHR to make it easier to use and more accessible at the point of care, but what they had to do was "go into another window" and type in their password again, when it would be nice if it "were actually something that could be part of the EHR where you just click on it and it pops up."[5]

## What actually makes symptom information actionable

Several factors emerged as critical:

1. **Clear clinical thresholds**: The patient is given the option to generate a notification if symptoms are at least 3 points or more below baseline or at least 3 points worse than their previous weeks' score. The notification is automatically generated if the symptoms are at least 6 points or worse than baseline, at least 6 points or worse than the previous weeks' score, or the most severe response on any individual question.[3]

2. **Integration into existing workflows**: The workflow was purposefully designed to be similar to how a care manager might handle a patient phone call about their symptoms so that workflow changes would be minimal.[3]

3. **Graphical presentation of trends**: The report included a graphical representation of longitudinal data showing baseline and subsequent symptoms. High-grade, worsening, or improving symptoms were highlighted with graphs that included that day's report as well as the preceding days' available data (up to 2 weeks) to identify trends. Raw symptom data for all symptoms reported in the preceding 2 weeks were also included.[10]

4. **Contextualization with activity data**: Providers noted that having additional information about activities and functioning could help them better understand how a patient's symptoms were interfering with their lives, asking "what's going on at home, what can they do, can they fold laundry, are they doing dishes, can they sit on their front porch and talk to their neighbors."[2]

## Preference for summarized data—but with access to details

All 5 projects provided health care professionals with data dashboards, which are Web-based tools that aggregate, summarize, and visualize PGHD. Participants reported that the ability to sort or summarize data in a descriptive manner, or to graph it in different ways, helped health care professionals to more quickly see patterns in the data patients' generated.[2]

However, this doesn't mean providers want *only* summaries. In addition to being able to visualize and manipulate data, health care professionals reported the need to customize their dashboards, with one nurse care manager customizing her dashboard homepage so the most relevant patient information (alerts) was the easiest to see.[2]

## Formats that doctors found particularly helpful

All hematologists agreed or strongly agreed that the platform was easy to use, and 87% agreed or strongly agreed that ePROs data were useful to enhance communication with their patients. The majority of physicians (78%) accessed the platform at least once per month to consult the symptom and health status profile of their patients.[11]

Almost all treating hematologists (95.6%) agreed or strongly agreed that the graphics about patients' health status displayed on the platform were easy to understand and interpret. 69.6% agreed and 13.0% strongly agreed that the platform helped them to better understand the patients' general health status and symptoms. Overall, 91.3% of physicians agreed or strongly agreed that ePRO is useful to more accurately document patients' symptomatic adverse events, with 82.6% finding it helpful to better identify low-grade adverse events.[11]

Standardized symptom reports were emailed via encrypted individual emails as PDFs to frontline and attending clinicians by 10 am each day if the patient or caregiver had completed the survey by that time.[10] The report format proved successful because it was: (1) delivered at a predictable time, (2) sent directly to clinicians, and (3) included graphical representations that highlighted concerning patterns.

## The bottom line: what doctors really need

Synthesizing across all studies, healthcare providers need symptom information that is:

1. **Visually summarized** with graphical trends over time
2. **Temporally contextualized** showing patterns not just snapshots  
3. **Easily accessible** within existing EHR workflows
4. **Actionable** with clear thresholds triggering specific responses
5. **Concise yet complete** following frameworks like the 8 characteristics of symptoms
6. **Structured** for key data but with narrative context for understanding
7. **Integrated with activity/function data** to show real-world impact
8. **Customizable** to individual provider workflow preferences

The fundamental insight: doctors don't want to replace clinical conversation with data—they want data that makes clinical conversations more focused, accurate, and efficient. Physicians value PROMs as tools that can enhance communication, detect hidden needs and support more person-centred decision-making—particularly at advanced stages of disease.[6] When symptom tracking succeeds, it's not because it eliminates work for providers, but because it does the preparatory work that makes clinical time more productive.
