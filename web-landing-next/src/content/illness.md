Sleep apnea

Most symptom-tracking users cluster around conditions with frequent, episodic, patternable flares (because tracking pays off fast).

The biggest clusters

Migraine / headache

Likely the single largest “symptom tracking” user base because there are huge dedicated trackers (millions of users) and strong trigger/pattern motivation.

Pain conditions

Chronic pain broadly (including widespread pain syndromes) drives tracking because severity varies day-to-day and people try to link pain to sleep, stress, activity, weather.

Fatigue + energy-limiting illness

Long COVID / ME/CFS / POTS / Fibromyalgia / EDS: heavy tracking around “crashes,” pacing, and exertion limits; Visible alone reports 100k+ people using it for these.

Mental health / mood

Anxiety, depression, bipolar, PTSD, etc. show up heavily in general trackers because mood is easy to log daily and users want correlations with sleep, meds, stress.

GI conditions

IBS and IBD (Crohn’s/UC) users track symptoms + food triggers; lots of diary-driven behavior.

Women’s health / hormonal

PCOS, endometriosis, PMDD: symptom variability across cycle makes tracking feel useful.

Diabetes

Massive tracking overall (glucose/insulin), though much of it is “metrics tracking” more than classic symptom journaling.
