# Value Propositions

Core messaging pillars for Chronic Life.

## Primary Value Prop

> **Track symptoms without draining your energy.**

Supporting: 20-second check-ins, flare mode on bad days, and a history that works when brain fog hits.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Energy-Conscious Design

**Problem:** Tracking feels like a full-time job
**Solution:** Under 30 seconds for daily logging

Key features:

- 20-second check-ins (tap energy, pick suspects, done)
- Flare mode (one tap when you're not okay)
- Smart defaults that learn your patterns
- No form bloat over time

**Proof point:** "20 seconds. That's it."

### 2. Doctor-Trust Output

**Problem:** Doctors don't use patient-tracked data
**Solution:** Export summaries designed by physicians, for physicians

Key features:

- 2-4 week trend snapshots (clean graphs)
- Flare frequency + duration
- Top suspected drivers you tagged
- One-page "what I need help with" summary

**Proof point:** "Scan in 30 seconds" (for the doctor)

### 3. Personal Assistant

**Problem:** Tracking without context is just data hoarding
**Solution:** An assistant that learns your patterns and suggests next steps

Key features:

- Spots when something is changing early
- Suggests tiny actions you can do today
- Preps visit summaries when you mention appointments
- Asks only the next best question (no interrogation)

**Proof point:** "Not just tracking—someone helping you steer."

## Differentiators

| Us                      | Them                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 20-second check-ins     | 5-minute forms        |
| Flare mode for bad days | Same interface always |
| Evidence with receipts  | Vague correlations    |

## Anti-Messaging

Never say:

- "Comprehensive symptom tracking"
- "Manage your health"
- "Take control of your condition"
- "All-in-one health platform"

Why: Generic, overused, doesn't acknowledge the struggle
