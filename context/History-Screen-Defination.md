History Screen — Definition

The History screen is the user’s daily health timeline.
It shows what was logged, when it happened, and how the day adds up—all in one glance.

What it does

Chronological memory: Each day as a compact card.

State snapshot: Mood, sleep, meds, stress, activity, notes.

Completion control: Clear “day complete” moment.

Edit-in-place: Tweak entries without breaking flow.

Anchor for insights: Feeds trends, reports, doctor summaries.

Why it matters

Reduces cognitive load: no recall, no guessing.

Builds trust: nothing is lost or hidden.

Creates narrative: “This is how my day actually went.”

Design principles

Day-first, not metric-first.

Scannable cards over dense charts.

Emotional signals (icons, colors) before numbers.

One tap from log → trend → report.

Alternate lenses

User: “I remember my day.”

Doctor: “I see patterns, not anecdotes.”

System: “Clean, structured time-series data.”
