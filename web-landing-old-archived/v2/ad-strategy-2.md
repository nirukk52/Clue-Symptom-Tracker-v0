This strategy is designed to drill down into the "Pattern Discovery" category, which you have already validated as your winning theme.

We are now testing which specific type of pattern value drives the strongest intent:

Prediction: "Tell me when it will happen so I can prepare."

Root Cause: "Tell me why it is happening so I can stop it."

Validation: "Prove that these random things are actually connected."

Here are your three Ad Groups for the final test.

Ad Group 1: The "Flare Forecaster" (Prediction Focus)
Hypothesis: The strongest user pain point is unpredictability. Users feel helpless against random attacks and want an "early warning system" to help them pace themselves.

Refined Keywords:

predict flare up

flare forecast app

chronic illness pacing calculator

early warning signs fibromyalgia

activity symptom correlation

pacing vs flare patterns

prevent crash chronic fatigue

symptom weather alert

1. The "Weather Forecast" Analogy

Headline: Your flares have a forecast. See it before it hits.

2. The "Pacing" Promise

Headline: Stop crashing. Know exactly when to rest before the flare starts.

3. The "Morning Alert"

Headline: Wake up knowing if today is a "push" day or a "rest" day.

Ad Group 2: The "Trigger Detective" (Root Cause Focus)
Hypothesis: The strongest user pain point is confusion. Users are exhausted by trying to guess if it was the pizza, the rain, or the stress that caused their pain. They want a specific answer.

Refined Keywords:

what’s triggering my symptoms

find symptom triggers

food sensitivity tracker

migraine triggers tracker

ibs trigger finder

sleep stress food symptoms

autoimmune flare triggers

diet vs pain correlation

2. The "Silent Trigger"

4. The "Investigation"

Headline: Turn your symptom log into a crime scene investigation. Find the cause.

Ad Group 3: The "Evidence Builder" (Validation Focus)
Hypothesis: The strongest user pain point is gaslighting (self or medical). Users want data to prove that their symptoms are real, connected, and scientific, not "just in their head."

Refined Keywords:

symptom correlation

connect the dots health

scientific evidence symptoms

supporting evidence for triggers

medical gaslighting proof

data driven symptom tracker

long covid biomarkers tracking

visualize pain patterns

1. The "Sanity Check"

Headline: Visualize your invisible illness. Turn your symptoms into hard data.

Implementation Note
Since you are keeping the image consistent (smart move for a headline test), ensure the image is neutral enough to support all three angles—for example, a clean visualization of a graph showing a clear spike or pattern on a mobile screen. This visually reinforces "Data/Insight" without biasing specifically toward "Weather" or "Food" unless the headline calls it out.
