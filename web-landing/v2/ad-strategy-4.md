Observation (what the winner tells you)
The winning ad works because it triggers pattern confusion (“something is wrong but I don’t know what”). High impressions = broad resonance, not commitment.

Problem: both ads are still vague promises. They attract attention but don’t test which pain is urgent enough to act on.

Next test hypothesis (what to test now)
Hypothesis 1 — Urgency beats curiosity

People click more when the promise removes immediate helplessness, not future insight.

Test:
Change from “figure it out” → “here’s what to do next.”

Ad:
“Sleep, stress, food, cycle — which one is actually making you worse?”

Landing (tight):
30-second ‘Top Suspects’ result → “Your top 2 likely triggers this week.”

Signal you’re testing:
Do users want answers now vs insights later?

Hypothesis 2 — Prediction > explanation

Users care more about avoiding the next flare than understanding the last one.

Test:
Split prediction vs explanation.

Variant A (explain):
“Find what’s causing your flares.”

Variant B (predict):
“Get warned before your next flare.”

Same visual. Same audience.
Only headline + landing promise changes.

Signal:
If prediction wins → build alerts, flare-risk score, “next 48h” framing.

Hypothesis 3 — Agency framing beats analysis framing

“Which factor is doing this” is analytical.
“What can I control” is emotional.

Test:
Reframe from causes → levers.

Ad:
“One small change could reduce your flares. Which one?”

Landing:
Show one actionable lever (sleep, pacing, food) with a confidence meter.

Signal:
If this wins → users want guidance, not dashboards.

What NOT to test yet

New visuals

New audiences

New channels

You already know the pattern-confusion hook works. Now you’re isolating which promise converts curiosity into intent.

Success metrics (important)

CTR → emotional resonance

Landing completion (quiz finished / CTA clicked) → intent
Ignore installs for now.

Why this sequencing works

You’re moving from:

“Something’s wrong” ✅ (validated)

→ “Tell me what matters”

→ “Tell me what to do”

That progression mirrors how chronic users actually think on bad days.
