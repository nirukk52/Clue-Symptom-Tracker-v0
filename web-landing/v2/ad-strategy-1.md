This validation strategy breaks down the "Pattern Discovery" winner into three distinct value propositions: Trigger Identification (The "Why"), Forecasting (The "When"), and Systemic Correlation (The "How").

This test will determine if users want to blame a specific cause, prepare for the future, or understand complex relationships.

Ad Group 1: The "Trigger Hunter"
Hypothesis: Users are looking for a specific "culprit" (e.g., a food, an activity, or a stressor) that is causing their pain. They view their illness as a mystery to be solved.Core Promise: Identify the root cause.

Keywords (Targeting):

what’s triggering my symptoms

find symptom triggers

food sensitivity tracker

migraine triggers tracker

ibs tracker

hidden flare causes

diet symptom diary

autoimmune trigger log

"why do I feel sick"

Ad Group 2: The "Flare Forecaster"
Hypothesis: Users are less concerned with "why" and more concerned with "when." They want to avoid crashes and plan their lives (Pacing/PEM).Core Promise: Predict and prevent the crash.

Strategic Note on Images
Since you are keeping the images consistent to isolate the headline variable, ensure the image is abstract enough to work for all three angles.

Recommendation: Use the "Collage vs. Organized Line" image (Creative 4 from your previous doc). It visually represents "Chaos to Order," which fits Trigger Hunting, Forecasting, and Correlation equally well.
